'2D Metaballs' (n-gons) animation inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JT_43qc0Dc&ab_channel=DefaultCube) video. N-gons weren't easy to make but I somehow figured it out. Metaball effect is really simple to make thanks to Smooth minimum Math node.

## old_film
Creates oldskool border on image, simple stuff :)

## pacman
<img align="left" src="pacman/gif.gif" width="20%" height="20%"/>

Simple pacman (loading?) animation. The hardest part were points which I yoinked from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xfb6bUSLoM&t=308s&ab_channel=DefaultCube) video.

## pong
The hardest and the most useless thing I've ever done. Position of ball was very interesting to calculate, but annoying to recreate with nodes. It's also a bit glitchy, but it works :)

## qr_code
Generates random QR code (recreation of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYDTvC43klc&ab_channel=DefaultCube) tutorial.)
